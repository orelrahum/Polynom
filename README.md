Polynom Project

Polynom Project:
This project include two main classes of polynomial monom. 
this two classes have a lot of fuctions about:
derivative , add ,substract , multiply, equals, isZero , root ,area and GUI

Monom Class:
This class for simple "Monom" of shape ax^b,
A its real number, and B its Natural number ( just positive and int number)
we can open new object on Monom with 3 ways:
1.Create new monom object and set the monom coefficient and the monom power. 
2.Create new monom object by other monom object (copy him). 
3. Create new monom object by send String.

Polynom Class:

the Polynom look like : "ax^b+ax^b-ax^b.....
we can open new object on Polynom with 3 ways:
1.Create an empty polynom. 
2.Create polynom object by type the polynom as a string. 
3.Create new polynom object by other polynom object (copy him).

Polynom Graph Class:

this class is Drawing for me my Polynom and calculetor the area and ExtremePoind 


note: 
we used with Ready Project  of eseifert
