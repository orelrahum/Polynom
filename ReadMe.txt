Polynom Project:

This project include two main classes of polynomial monom. 
this two classes have a lot of fuctions about:
derivative , add ,substract , multiply, equals, isZero , root ,area and GUI

Monom Class:
This class for simple "Monom" of shape ax^b,
A its real number, and B its Natural number ( just positive and int number)
we can open new object on Monom with 3 ways:
1.Create new monom object and set the monom coefficient and the monom power. 
2.Create new monom object by other monom object (copy him). 
3. Create new monom object by send String.


monoms class have some functions:
1.add monoms with the same power
2. calculate specific x
3.derivative 
4.multiply two monoms
5.check if two monoms are equals
6. check if the monom is the zero monom
7. substract between two monoms with the same power

Polynom Class:

the Polynom look like : "ax^b+ax^b-ax^b.....
we can open new object on Polynom with 3 ways:
1.Create an empty polynom. 
2.Create polynom object by type the polynom as a string. 
3.Create new polynom object by other polynom object (copy him).


polynom class have some functions:
1.add monom to our polynom
2. add polynom to our polynom 
3.substract between two polynoms
4.substract monom from our polynom
5.multiply two polynoms
6.check if two polynoms are equals
7. check if the polynom is the zero monom
8. root-finds a root value of a polynom while given 2 values that 1 is positive and the other negative and eps which will make sure that we are eps close to the 0.
9. create a deep copy of this Polynum
10.derivative of the polynom 
11.area - Compute Riemann's Integral over this Polynom starting from x0, till x1 using eps size steps.
12.Iterator (of Monoms) over this Polynom
13. calculate specific x to the polynom 
14. GUI- Drawing for me my Polynom and calculetor the area and ExtremePoind
